/**
 * The named conflict surface for the cloud-todo MUTABLE archetype (S5-CONFLICT).
 *
 * Store5's `Updater` does not consume a [ConflictStrategy] itself, so the policy has to be
 * applied by hand at the one point where BOTH the server echo and the client value exist —
 * inside `Updater.post`. Previously that meant a bare `ConflictStrategy.ClientWins()` literal
 * inline in [provideCloudTodoStore]: the policy worked, but it had no name, no test seam, and
 * no way for a caller to tell an ordinary write apart from one that actually diverged. This
 * resolver is that surface.
 *
 * [resolve] returns both the winning value AND whether the two sides had genuinely diverged,
 * so the caller can distinguish "server echoed what we sent" from "server had something else
 * and we overrode it" — the input a `MutationResult.Conflicted` outcome needs. Collapsing the
 * two is how a silent overwrite reaches the user as a plain success.
