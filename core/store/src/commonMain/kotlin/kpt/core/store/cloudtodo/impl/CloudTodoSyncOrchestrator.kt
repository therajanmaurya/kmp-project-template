/**
 * Drains the cloud-todo write backlog when connectivity returns (S5-SYNC).
 *
 * The MUTABLE archetype records a failed write through its [Bookkeeper] — but recording is
 * only half of offline-first. Before this orchestrator existed, cloud-todo was the one demo
 * that writes to a real server, injected a `RoomBookkeeper`, faithfully recorded every write
 * that failed while offline, and then **never retried any of them**: the row sat in
 * `store_bookkeeper` forever and the user's toggle silently never reached the server. The
 * sibling features (loans, bill reminders, alerts) each drive an `OfflineSubmitSyncer`; the
 * one feature with a real network write had no equivalent.
 *
 * `OfflineSubmitSyncer` is not reusable here: it drains a `SubmitOutbox` of PAYLOADS, whereas
 * the MutableStore path records KEYS in the bookkeeper and rebuilds the payload from the
 * source of truth. So this is the store-side counterpart, not a second copy — it enumerates
 * [BookkeeperDao.pendingKeys], re-issues the write for each, and clears the bookkeeper entry
 * only on success. It reuses the SAME [RetryOnNetworkStatus] and [RetryPolicy] objects the
 * outbox syncer uses, so both drains agree on what "online" means and on how hard to push.
 *
 * @param scope Long-lived scope (the app scope) the watcher runs in.
 * @param networkMonitor Connectivity source — retries fire on the offline → online edge.
 * @param bookkeeperDao Enumerates the outstanding failures.
 * @param bookkeeper Consulted per key and cleared on a successful replay.
 * @param loadLocal Rebuilds the payload for a key from the source of truth.
 * @param writeBlock Re-issues the write (the same path the UI uses).
 * @param retryOnStatus Which statuses count as "can retry now".
 * @param retryPolicy Backoff between attempts within one drain.
 * @param onReplayError Error sink — a replay that throws is reported, never swallowed. Declared
 *   as a plain lambda rather than a `CrashReporter` parameter so `core/store` (the Store5
 *   keystone) does not take a dependency on `core-base/observability`; the DI site in
 *   `core/data` passes the real reporter in.
