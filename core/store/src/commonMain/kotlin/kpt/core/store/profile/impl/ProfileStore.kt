 * The read PORT for the profile store.

 * The template's profile data is the app display name, which comes from `AppInfo` in

 * the source, exactly as the calculator features bind their compute ports.

 *
 * The template's profile is a static local placeholder, so this store is deliberately thin —
 * its value is the SEAM, not the caching. A real fork's profile screen loads a signed-in user
 * over the network, and because the read path is already
 * `store → repository.profileStream(scope) → ScreenState → ScreenContent`, that fork changes
 * ONE thing — this fetcher — instead of restructuring a Composable that read a constant
 * directly. Shipping the static screen without the seam is what forces that later rewrite.
