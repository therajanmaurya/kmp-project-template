 * dependency cycle (store → domain → data → store). The store therefore owns the interface
 * and the FEATURE module binds the real `calculateEmi` implementation into Koin — the
 * dependency is satisfied at runtime, not at compile time, and the layer order (store below
 * domain) is preserved.

 * an in-memory cache keyed on [EmiParams]. Re-entering a parameter set the user already tried
 * — the common case while dragging a tenure slider back and forth — is served from cache
 * instead of recomputed, and the result reaches the screen as a `ScreenState` like every other
 * read surface, so the calculator renders through the same `ScreenContent` wrapper as the rest
 * of the app rather than a bespoke nullable `StateFlow`.
 *
 * MEMORY_ONLY is only legal because no `cache_strategy` is declared for this feature (SC2).
