/**
 * Build an offline-only [Store] for tracked personal loans.
 *
 * Backed exclusively by [LoanDao] (OFFLINE_LOCAL_ONLY archetype) — loans are
 * user-managed local records with no remote sync. The repository layer writes
 * via [LoanDao.upsert]; this store surfaces the full list reactively.
 *
 * Key: [Unit] — returns all loans sorted by soonest due date (DAO default order).
 * Per-loan observation (`observeById`) is handled directly by the repository.
 *
 * The DAO reader is wrapped with [daoFlow] so wasmJs collectors re-emit after writes
 * even when Room 3 alpha05's async InvalidationTracker fails to fan out (see
 * `core-base/database/.../invalidation/README.md`). On Android/Desktop/iOS the wrap
 * is a microsecond no-op alongside Room's native invalidation.
