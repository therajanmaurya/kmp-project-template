/**
 * In-memory fake of [WatchlistDao] whose reactive reads are **cold snapshots** — each
 * subscription emits the current rows exactly once, then completes.
 *
 * This deliberately models the wasmJs failure mode the invalidation bridge exists to
 * absorb: Room 3 alpha05's `InvalidationTracker` does NOT fan out to a live collector
 * after a write on the single-threaded JS event loop, so the DAO `Flow` never re-emits
 * on its own. A correct repository therefore MUST re-emit via `daoFlow { }` re-subscribing
 * on the `RoomChangeBus` signal published by `notifyingWrite { }`.
 *
 * Contrast with [kpt.core.data.demo.banking.FakeLoanDao], which uses a hot
 * `MutableStateFlow` — that self-emits and RACES the `daoFlow` re-collect, which is why
 * the banking reactive tests are `@Ignore`d. A cold snapshot has exactly one re-emit
 * source (the bridge), so the assertion is deterministic.
