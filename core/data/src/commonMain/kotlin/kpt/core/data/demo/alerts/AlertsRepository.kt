 * Repository for the Price Alerts feature.
 *
 * Read side: observable list of committed alerts (from the Store-backed [AlertsRepository.alertsStream]).
 * Pending drafts (in the framework outbox) are tracked at the form-handler
 * level via `DraftSubmitHandler` — the `framework_submit_drafts` row for
 * formKey `"price_alert"` indicates an in-flight or failed submission, surfaced
 * to the user via the form screen's `DraftResumeBanner` rather than the list.
 *
 * Write side: [submitAlert] is the suspend block passed to
 * `DraftSubmitHandler.submit { repo.submitAlert(payload) }`. On network failure
 * the handler persists the payload to the outbox; on reconnect, the
 * [kpt.core.base.store.submit.OfflineSubmitSyncer] retries it through the
 * same block.
