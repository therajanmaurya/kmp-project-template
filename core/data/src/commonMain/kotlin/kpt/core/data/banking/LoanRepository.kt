/**
 * User's personal loan portfolio — purely local persistence, no remote sync.
 *
 * Backs the B1 Loan Tracker feature. Reads are reactive [Flow]s; writes are
 * `suspend` and go through [upsert] / [delete]. Edit UX wraps these in
 * `DraftSubmitHandler` so the "saving…" badge + retry-on-failure polish
 * applies even though the "submit" is a local commit with no network call.
