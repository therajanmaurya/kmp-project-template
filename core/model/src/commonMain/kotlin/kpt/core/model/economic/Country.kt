package kpt.core.model.economic

/**
 * Country reference for the Banking Utility Toolkit's macro-indicator screens.
 *
 * Distinct from [kpt.core.model.currency.Country] which is a
 * phone-number-formatting model. The toolkit screens need only the World
 * Bank-accepted ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code plus a localised display name and a
 * flag emoji — no phone metadata.
 *
 * @property code ISO 3166-1 alpha-2, e.g. `"US"`, `"IN"`, `"DE"`. Forwarded
 *   unchanged to [kpt.core.network.worldbank.api.WorldBankApi.indicator].
 * @property name English short name, e.g. `"United States"`, `"India"`.
 * @property flagEmoji Unicode flag glyph composed from the regional-indicator
 *   pair for [code]. Falls back to a globe emoji for non-country regions if
 *   ever needed (currently every entry resolves to a valid flag).
