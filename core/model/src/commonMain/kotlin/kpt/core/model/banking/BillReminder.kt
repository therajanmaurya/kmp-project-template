/**
 * A recurring (or one-time) bill the user wants to be reminded about.
 * Purely local — no remote sync, no calendar export. The "reminder" itself
 * is delivered by the in-app notification surface; this record is the
 * declarative configuration.
 *
 * Serializable so the offline-resilient `DraftSubmitHandler` can persist the
 * payload across process death even though the "submit" target is a
 * local-only [kpt.core.data.banking.BillReminderRepository] commit.
 *
 * @property id Stable identifier (client-generated UUID). Primary key.
 * @property name Bill label, e.g. "Electricity Bill", "Netflix".
 * @property amount Expected charge amount.
 * @property dueDay Day-of-month the bill is due (1-31). For months without
 *   that day (e.g. day 31 in February), the dashboard clamps to month-end.
 * @property recurrence How often the bill repeats; [Recurrence.ONCE] for
 *   single-occurrence bills.
 * @property category Coarse category used for grouping in the dashboard.
 * @property enabled Whether the reminder fires; disabled reminders persist
 *   but are silent until re-enabled.
 * @property reminderDaysBefore How many days before [dueDay] the reminder
 *   surfaces. Default = 1 (next-day reminder).
 * @property createdAtMs Epoch millis when the reminder was first saved.
 * @property updatedAtMs Epoch millis of the most recent edit.
