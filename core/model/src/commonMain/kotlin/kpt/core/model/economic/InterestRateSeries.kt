/**
 * Domain representation of an interest-rate time series sourced from FRED
 * (Federal Reserve Economic Data).
 *
 * The default consumer is the Banking Utility Toolkit's "B7 Interest Rate Tracker"
 * screen. Series identifiers ([seriesId]) align 1:1 with FRED's public series
 * catalogue — e.g. `DFF` (Effective Federal Funds Rate), `DPRIME` (Bank Prime Loan
 * Rate), `MORTGAGE30US` (30-Year Fixed Mortgage Average).
 *
 * @property seriesId FRED series identifier (case-sensitive).
 * @property name Human-readable label, e.g. "Federal Funds Rate".
 * @property current Most recent observation value (latest entry in [observations]).
 * @property unit Unit of measure: typically `"%"` for rates, `"USD"` for nominal series.
 * @property observations Time-ordered observations (typically last 365 days). Empty
 *   when the series has no published data in the requested window.
 * @property source Upstream data source — currently always `"FRED"`.
