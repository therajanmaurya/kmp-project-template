/**
 * Wizard payload — the serialized snapshot of the loan-calc wizard at the
 * current step. Serializable so the offline-resilient `DraftSubmitHandler` can
 * persist it across process death and the next session can resume in-place.
 *
 * The wizard advances Amount → Tenure → Rate → Review → Save. [currentStep]
 * is the 1-based step the user was on when the snapshot was taken.
 *
 * Lives in `core/model/banking/` (not `feature/calculators/`) so the outbox
 * binding in `core/data/.../RepositoryModule.kt` can reference it without
 * pulling a layer-violating feature → core dep.
 *
 * @property scenarioId Stable identifier for this in-progress wizard run. New
 *   wizards generate a UUID-ish id; resumed wizards re-use the prior id.
 * @property name User-supplied label for the scenario (filled at Review).
 * @property principal Loan amount entered at step 1.
 * @property ratePercent APR entered at step 3.
 * @property tenureMonths Tenure entered at step 2.
 * @property currentStep 1..5 — used to restore the UI to its last step on resume.
