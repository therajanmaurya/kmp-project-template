/**
 * Domain representation of a country-level macro indicator sourced from the

 *
 * The default consumer is the Banking Utility Toolkit's "B8 Country Macro Snapshot"
 * screen. Country identifiers ([countryCode]) use ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes (e.g.
 * `US`, `IN`, `DE`). The World Bank also accepts alpha-3 (`USA`, `IND`, `DEU`)
 * — both are forwarded through unchanged.
 *
 * @property countryCode ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code, e.g. `"US"`.
 * @property countryName Human-readable country name from the World Bank metadata.
 * @property indicator Which macro series this row represents — see [IndicatorKind].
 * @property observations Per-year observations, ordered ascending by [IndicatorObservation.year].
 *   Empty when the World Bank has no published data for the requested span.
 * @property source Upstream data source — currently always `"World Bank Open Data"`.
