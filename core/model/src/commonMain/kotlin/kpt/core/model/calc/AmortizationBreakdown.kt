/**
 * One amortization calculation: the per-installment [rows] and the [summary] totals.
 *
 * Both halves derive from the SAME inputs, so they are one Store value rather than two
 * independently-cached ones — a screen can never render a schedule from one parameter set
 * beside a summary from another.
 *
 * Reuses [AmortizationRow] (`core/model/demo/banking`), the same row type `feature/amortization`
 * renders, so the two amortization surfaces agree on one shape.
