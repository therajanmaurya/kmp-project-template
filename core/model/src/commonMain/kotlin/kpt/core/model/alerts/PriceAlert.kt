/**
 * A price alert configured by the user for a specific coin.
 *
 * Serializable because [kpt.core.data.alerts.AlertsRepository] persists
 * unsent alerts to the `framework_submit_drafts` outbox during offline
 * submission — RoomSubmitOutbox writes the payload as JSON.
 *
 * @property id Stable identifier (UUID or other client-generated id). Used as the
 *   primary key both client-side and on the fake server.
 * @property coinId CoinGecko identifier (e.g., "bitcoin", "ethereum").
 * @property direction Above / Below / PCT_CHANGE comparison applied to [targetValue].
 * @property targetValue Threshold value — interpreted in USD for ABOVE/BELOW,
 *   in percentage for PCT_CHANGE.
 * @property enabled Whether the alert is currently active. Disabled alerts persist
 *   but don't trigger notifications.
 * @property createdAtMs Epoch millis when the alert was first saved (client time).
