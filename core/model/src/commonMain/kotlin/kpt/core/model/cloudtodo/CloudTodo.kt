/**
 * A cloud-synced todo — the toolkit's MUTABLE (offline-write) Store5 archetype showcase.
 * Reads come from jsonplaceholder `GET /todos/{id}`; toggling `completed` writes back via
 * the Store5 [org.mobilenativefoundation.store.store5.Updater] (`PUT /todos/{id}`), and a
 * failed write (offline) is recorded by the RoomBookkeeper for retry on reconnect. Pure Kotlin.
