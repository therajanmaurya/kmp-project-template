 * What the profile screen displays.
 *
 * In the template this carries only the app's display name — the demo profile is a local,
 * signed-out placeholder. It is a real domain model rather than a raw `String` because a fork
 * replaces the *fetcher*, not the screen: swapping in a signed-in user means widening this
 * model and returning it from the store, with the ViewModel and Composable untouched.
