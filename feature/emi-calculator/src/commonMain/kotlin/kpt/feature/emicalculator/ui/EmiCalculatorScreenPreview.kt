/*
 * @Preview siblings for the device-free CMP render tier (SCREENSHOT_TEST.md CMP-PRIMARY).
 * `CommonComposablePreviewScanner` auto-discovers these from commonMain and renders them off
 * `desktopTest` — no emulator, no Robolectric.
 *
 * `EmiCalculatorScreen` is the stateful wrapper (it resolves its ViewModel through Koin);
 * `EmiCalculatorScreenContent` is the stateless body, so it is what gets rendered here.
 *
 * The calculator reads through the same `ScreenContent` wrapper as every other read surface, so its
 * result panel has real Loading / Content / Empty / Error states rather than hand-rolled null
 * checks. Each is previewed: Empty is the "inputs not yet complete" case a user sees on first
 * open, and Error is the one that must offer a retry.
