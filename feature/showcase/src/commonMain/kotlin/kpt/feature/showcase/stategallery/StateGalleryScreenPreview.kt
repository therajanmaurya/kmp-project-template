/*
 * @Preview siblings for the device-free CMP render tier (SCREENSHOT_TEST.md CMP-PRIMARY).
 * `CommonComposablePreviewScanner` auto-discovers these from commonMain and renders them off
 * `desktopTest` — no emulator, no Robolectric.
 *
 * `StateGalleryScreen` IS directly previewable — it is a dev-only gallery that hand-builds every
 * `ScreenState` side by side and owns no Store, so it needs no Koin graph. That is also why it
 * carries a `screen_composable_excludes` waiver for the OTHER gate: delegating it to `ScreenContent`
 * would destroy the only thing it exists to do (a Store cannot be asked to produce `NoNetwork` on
 * demand). Previewing the whole screen here is therefore the honest render, not a shortcut.
 *
 * Literals are PREVIEW FIXTURE DATA — never reachable from the shipped app (this screen is gated on
 * `!isReleaseBuild()`).
