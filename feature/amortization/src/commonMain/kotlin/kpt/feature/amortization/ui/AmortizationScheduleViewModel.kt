/**
 * ViewModel for [AmortizationScheduleScreen].
 *
 * Derives a complete month-by-month payment schedule from the current loan snapshot
 * held in [LoanRepository]. The computation is purely local — no network call,
 * no Room insert — so it uses [ScreenState] via a simple `observeById` → `map` pipeline
 * (the OFFLINE_LOCAL_ONLY archetype).
 *
 * **Why not PagingScreenStream?**
 * [kpt.core.base.store.paging.PagingScreenStream] is designed for unbounded
 * network-paginated lists. Amortization rows are finite (≤ 360 for a 30-year mortgage),
 * computed in microseconds, and never fetched from a network. `LazyColumn` handles the
 * rendering lazily at draw time — there is nothing to paginate at the data layer.
 * Forcing `PagingScreenStream` here would add network-monitor + fetched-at-repository
 * dependencies for zero benefit.
 *
 * The [loanId] is injected via Koin `parametersOf(loanId)` so each route creates a fresh
 * ViewModel scoped to the navigation entry.
