/**
 * Read-side ViewModel for [LoanDetailScreen].
 *
 * Observes a single loan by id and projects to [ScreenState]:
 * - Loan exists → [ScreenState.Content]
 * - Loan was never saved or has been deleted → [ScreenState.Empty]
 *
 * The [loanId] is injected via Koin `parametersOf(loanId)` (see `LoansModule`) so each
 * navigation event creates a fresh VM scoped to the route argument.
 *
 * **Phase 5 archetype additions (showcase only — do not remove):**
 *
 * [loadOnceScreenState] demonstrates the **asLoadOnceStream** pattern: the stream stops
 * emitting after the first [ScreenState.Content] so in-progress user edits are never
 * overwritten by background refreshes from Room's reactive query. This is the recommended
 * pattern for any edit-capable detail screen backed by a reactive local store.
 *
 * [combinedState] demonstrates the **ScreenWithMutationStream** seam: the read-only
 * [loadOnceScreenState] is fused with a [SubmitHandler] write pipeline into one
 * [StateFlow<CombinedState<Loan, Loan>>], so the screen renders against a single value
 * covering Loading/Content/Error on the read side and Idle/Submitting/Submitted/Failed
 * on the write side. [submitEdit] is the screen-facing API to trigger a save.
