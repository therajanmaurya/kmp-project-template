/*
 * @Preview siblings for the device-free CMP render tier (SCREENSHOT_TEST.md CMP-PRIMARY).
 * `CommonComposablePreviewScanner` auto-discovers these from commonMain and renders them off
 * `desktopTest` — no emulator, no Robolectric.
 *
 * The `*Screen` entry composable is never previewed: it resolves its ViewModel through Koin, so it
 * cannot render outside a running graph. Literals below are PREVIEW FIXTURE DATA — never reachable
 * from the running app, so G-SOURCE-I18N excludes `*Preview.kt` from its scan.
