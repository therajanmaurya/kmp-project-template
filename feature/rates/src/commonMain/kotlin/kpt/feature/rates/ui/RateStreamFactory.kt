 * Per-series stream + refresh seam used by [InterestRatesViewModel].

 * Why an interface rather than calling `EconomicRatesRepository` directly?
 * The framework's `ScreenDataStream<T>` has an `internal` constructor — feature
 * modules can obtain instances but cannot fake them in unit tests. This thin
 * seam moves the stream + refresh contract into the feature module so the test
 * can swap in a `Flow`-backed fake without touching framework internals.
 *
 * The production implementation is [DefaultRateStreamFactory] which delegates
 * straight to the framework repository.
