/**
 * MUTABLE-archetype write-path ViewModel — the reference implementation for driving
 * [kpt.core.base.store.mutation.MutationGateway] from a screen.
 *
 * The read side is an ordinary offline-first [ScreenDataStream]; the write side demonstrates the two
 * [kpt.core.base.store.mutation.MutationPolicy] arms and surfaces the returned [MutationResult]
 * exhaustively. That exhaustiveness is the point: `MutationResult` is a sealed interface precisely so
 * a ViewModel cannot silently swallow an offline write or a conflict, and mapping every arm to a
 * rendered [MutationOutcome] is what proves it.
 *
 * Spec: `idea-layer/screens/cloudtodo/{docs,ui,flow,api,tests}.yaml`.
