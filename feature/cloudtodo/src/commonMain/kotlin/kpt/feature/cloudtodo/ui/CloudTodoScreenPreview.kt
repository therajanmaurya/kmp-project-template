/*
 * @Preview siblings for the device-free CMP render tier (SCREENSHOT_TEST.md CMP-PRIMARY).
 * `CommonComposablePreviewScanner` auto-discovers these from commonMain and renders them off
 * `desktopTest` — no emulator, no Robolectric.
 *
 * `CloudTodoScreen` is not previewed: it resolves its ViewModel through Koin. Literals below are
 * PREVIEW FIXTURE DATA — never reachable from the running app.
 *
 * `MutationOutcome` is the whole reason this demo exists: `MutationResult` is a sealed interface so
 * every write outcome — queued offline, conflicted, rolled back — reaches the user as its own
 * treatment rather than a generic toast. Each arm therefore gets its own preview; a single
 * happy-path render would leave the offline and conflict cards, the two the user most needs to
 * understand, completely uncovered.
