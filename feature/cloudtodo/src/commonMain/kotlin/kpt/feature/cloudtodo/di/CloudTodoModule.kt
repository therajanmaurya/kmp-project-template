 * Koin module for the Cloud Todo feature — the MUTABLE store-archetype write-path demo.
 *
 * A single ViewModel over `CloudTodoRepository`, which is already bound by
 * `core/data`'s DemoRepositoryModule (it wires the read Store, the MutableStore and the
 * MutationGateway). Nothing extra is needed here: the point of this feature is that a screen can
 * drive the whole write path through the repository contract alone.
