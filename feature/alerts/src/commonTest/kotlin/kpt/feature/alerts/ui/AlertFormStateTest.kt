/**
 * Locks [AlertFormState.canSubmit] — the create-alert submit gate.
 *
 * `feature/alerts` had NO test source set at all, despite being a write path: it is the only
 * store-backed feature that shipped with zero tests. `canSubmit` is the guard that decides whether a
 * price alert can be persisted, so its boundaries (blank coin, unparseable target, zero, negative)
 * are exactly where a bad row reaches the database.
