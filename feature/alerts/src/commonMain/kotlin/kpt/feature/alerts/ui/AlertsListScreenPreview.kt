 * @Preview siblings for the device-free CMP render tier (SCREENSHOT_TEST.md CMP-PRIMARY).
 * `CommonComposablePreviewScanner` auto-discovers these from commonMain and renders them off
 * `desktopTest` — no emulator, no Robolectric.
 *
 * The `*Screen` entry composables are not previewed: they resolve their ViewModel through Koin.
 * Literals below are PREVIEW FIXTURE DATA — never reachable from the running app — hence
 * G-SOURCE-I18N excludes `*Preview.kt` from its scan rather than asking for them to be translated.
