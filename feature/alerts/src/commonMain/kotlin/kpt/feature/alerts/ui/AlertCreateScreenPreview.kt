/*
 * @Preview siblings for the device-free CMP render tier — see AlertsListScreenPreview.kt for the
 * full rationale, including why fixture literals are not translated.
 *
 * `AlertCreateScreen` is the stateful wrapper (it resolves its ViewModel through Koin);
 * `AlertCreateScreenContent` is the stateless body rendered here.
 *
 * This screen is the `submit_offline_write` demo, so the states that matter are the WRITE states:
 * a submit in flight, a network failure that kept the payload in the outbox, and the three-case
 * resume prompt. Each gets its own preview — the happy empty form is the least interesting one.
