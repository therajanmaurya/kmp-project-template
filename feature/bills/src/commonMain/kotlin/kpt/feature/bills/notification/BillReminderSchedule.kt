package kpt.feature.bills.notification

/**
 * Feature-local payload describing a single bill-reminder notification.
 *
 * Producers (the bill ViewModels) build this from a [kpt.core.model.banking.BillReminder] by
 * computing the next concrete `triggerAtMs` instant; [BillNotificationGateway] maps it onto the
 * cross-platform `sync` scheduling infra (worker-kmp + KMPNotifier).
 *
 * @property billId Stable identifier for the bill — used as the unique-work name (re-scheduling the
 *   same bill replaces the prior request) and as a per-bill cancel tag.
 * @property title Short text shown in the OS notification heading.
 * @property body Longer body text shown in the OS notification.
 * @property triggerAtMs Epoch-millis when the notification should fire. Instants already in the past
 *   produce a silent no-op (callers compute the next occurrence themselves).
