/**
 * Pure-functional recurrence math for [BillReminder] — kept feature-local so the math
 * isn't paid for by every consumer of `core/model`.
 *
 * Two operations live here:
 *  - [nextDueDate] — compute the next concrete [LocalDate] a bill is "due", anchored at
 *    a reference `today`. Handles MONTHLY / QUARTERLY / ANNUALLY / ONCE plus the
 *    month-end-clamp policy for `dueDay > daysInMonth` (e.g. day 31 in February → Feb 28/29).
 *  - [reminderTriggerMs] — convert the next-due [LocalDate] back to an epoch-millis
 *    instant `reminderDaysBefore` days earlier, snapped to local 9:00 AM in the supplied
 *    [TimeZone].
 *
 * Tests pin both behaviours; the schedule produced here flows into
 * [kpt.feature.bills.notification.BillNotificationGateway.schedule].
