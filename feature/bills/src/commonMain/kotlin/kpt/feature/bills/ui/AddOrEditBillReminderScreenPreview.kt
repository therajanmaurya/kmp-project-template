 * @Preview siblings for the device-free CMP render tier — see BillRemindersListScreenPreview.kt for
 * the full rationale.
 *
 * `AddOrEditBillReminderScreen` is not previewed: it resolves its ViewModel through Koin. Its form
 * sections are, and each is rendered twice — enabled and mid-submit — because the whole form
 * disables itself while a submit is in flight, and a form that only LOOKS disabled is how a user
 * ends up typing edits that are already lost.
