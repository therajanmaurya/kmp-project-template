# asc-attach-subscriptions.rb — put the app's subscriptions INTO the App Store review submission.
#
# THE GAP THIS CLOSES
# A subscription reaching READY_TO_SUBMIT is not in the review. It has to be ATTACHED, and until it
# is, its version sits at PREPARE_FOR_SUBMISSION and the app ships reviewed WITHOUT its in-app
# purchases. Observed on a live app (2026-09-18): the app version was submitted alone, two
# subscriptions sat in a separate UNSUBMITTED draft, and a third was attached to nothing at all.
# Nothing reported a problem — the version submission succeeded, because from its point of view it
# had everything it needed.
#
# THE MECHANISM (verified against the live API, not inferred)
#   · `reviewSubmissionItems` does NOT accept a `subscription` relationship — Apple answers
#     409 ENTITY_ERROR.RELATIONSHIP.UNKNOWN. Several plausible names (inAppPurchaseV2, subscriptionV2,
#     iap, inAppPurchase) are all rejected the same way.
#   · The dedicated resource is `POST /v1/subscriptionSubmissions` with a `subscription`
#     relationship. It creates the pending-version submission, which joins the app's open review
#     submission as an item.
#   · The ACT OF ATTACHING is what moves the subscriptionVersion PREPARE_FOR_SUBMISSION →
#     READY_FOR_REVIEW. The state is a consequence of attachment, not a precondition for it.
#
# So "is this subscription in the review?" is answered by its VERSION state, not by the subscription
# state: a subscription reads READY_TO_SUBMIT whether or not it is attached.
#
# Usage:
#   asc-attach-subscriptions.rb --bundle-id <id> --key-id <k> --issuer <i> --p8 <path.p8>
#                               [--dry-run] [--require-subscriptions]
#
# This step ATTACHES an existing catalogue; it never CREATES one. Creation belongs to whatever owns
# the product catalogue (for a PayCraft-backed app, the dashboard's product sync, which already
# provisions group / subscription / availability / prices / localizations / review screenshot).
# Growing a second catalogue source here would just be drift with two writers.
#
# Apple's refusal detail is vague ("please check associated errors") but the reasons ARE in the
# payload, nested under `errors[].meta.associatedErrors` keyed by resource path. The most common one
# is not a defect at all: FIRST_SUBSCRIPTION_MUST_BE_SUBMITTED_ON_VERSION — an app's first
# subscription must be submitted TOGETHER WITH an app version, which is exactly why the submit script
# adds the version item first and attaches before flipping `submitted`.
#
# There is no direct state write: `subscriptionVersions` allows only CREATE and GET_INSTANCE, so a
# PATCH to set READY_FOR_REVIEW is refused 403. Submission is the only transition.
#
# Exit: 0 = every sellable subscription is attached (or already in review / live)
#       4 = at least one could NOT be attached — Apple's nested reasons are printed
#       1 = hard error (auth, app not found)
