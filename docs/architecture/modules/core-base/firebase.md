## API reference

_Generated from `core-base/firebase` at tree `e7e4569468a5` by `scripts/docs/api-docs-gen.sh`._
_Do not hand-edit inside this block — re-run the generator. Authored prose belongs outside it._

This module is **framework-shared and read-only to generators** (D9). Everything below is
something a feature CALLS; re-declaring one of these in `core/**` is the duplicate-the-
framework defect. A change here is a TEMPLATE change and flows upstream as a draft PR
(RULE-TEMPLATE-MODULE-FIX-UPSTREAM-001), never a local fix.

### `core-base/firebase/src/commonMain/kotlin/kpt/core/base/firebase/di/FirebaseModule.kt`

```kotlin
val firebaseModule: Module = module
```
Base Firebase integration (the "main implementation", template-owned in core-base/firebase).
