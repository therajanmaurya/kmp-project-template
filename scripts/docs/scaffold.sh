# scripts/docs/scaffold.sh — create/refresh the docs/architecture tree FROM DISK.
#
# Coverage is complete by construction: add a module, re-run, and its guide exists. Never overwrites
# authored prose — a guide that already carries content below its `<!-- scaffold:end -->` marker
# keeps it.
#
# Each guide is seeded with MEASURED facts (public API, tests, annotations defined and consumed,
# corpus surface, dependents) rather than placeholder text, because a stub that says "TODO: describe
# this module" is worse than no file: it looks like coverage and teaches nothing.
#
# THIS SHIPS IN THE TEMPLATE so the docs Action can create a page for a NEW module with no framework
# checkout. Without it the pipeline had a hole: `api-docs-gen.sh` injects INTO an existing page, so a
# newly added module had nowhere for its API block to go and the gate failed with "module has sources
# but NO architecture page" — a failure CI could report and not fix.
